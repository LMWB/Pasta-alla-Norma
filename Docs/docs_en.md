## âœ¨ Modes of Light

Your AuroraLamp has a small **3-position jumper** underneath.  
Each position unlocks a different world of color:

### ðŸŒˆ 1. Rainbow Fade
A continuous flow through the full color spectrum.  
Watch red melt into orange, drift to green, slide into blue and violet â€” then gently return to the start.  
Perfect for calm evenings or creative work sessions.

### ðŸ”¥ 2. Sunstorm
From the deep glow of molten orange to blinding flashes of near-white â€”  
this mode captures the drama of a solar storm.  
Warm, intense, and full of motion.  
Ideal for energizing the room or giving your setup a futuristic pulse.

### ðŸŽ„ 3. Christmas Glow
Traditional colors, reinvented.  
Green pines, golden warmth, and a hint of red shimmer fade gracefully together.  
A soft and festive light that feels alive â€” not blinking, but breathing.

## âš¡ Power
Just plug in any **USB-C power source** â€” your laptop, charger, or power bank.  
The lamp remembers its last mode when power is restored.

## ðŸ’¡ About the Design
AuroraLamp isnâ€™t just a gadget â€” itâ€™s a craft.  
Each color blend is tuned with **gamma-corrected fading**,  
a technology that mimics the way the human eye perceives light.  
The result: perfectly smooth transitions and natural brightness.
